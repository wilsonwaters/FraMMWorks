   * Doing a paste with no selection caused one frame to be deleted before doing the paste.
   * Write open failures were being reported again when the target file couldn't be opened a second time in fast I/O mode, which happens sometimes with emulators or remote drives. The slower fallback has been reinstated.
   * Running out of disk space at the very end of a render operation was sometimes reported as an I/O error rather than a write error.
   * Sampling in filter preview could fail if the timeline had been edited.

   * Fixed display panes not always updating properly.
   * Fixed rare crash if an MPEG-1 open failed extremely early.
   * Fixed cases where the render start/end point wasn't updated properly when a selection bound was used to "push" the other, i.e. "set end" before start, or vice versa.

   * Jobs using WAV file audio didn't close the WAV file after completion, keeping it locked across subsequent jobs.
   * Appended file lists were being written out in job scripts in ANSI rather than UTF-8, causing problems with high-plane characters.
   * Audio information in File Information wasn't taking all samples into account.
   * Long paths in the most recently used (MRU) list now ellipsize.
   * Lowered priority of livelock messages to Info so they don't flag as warnings in the job queue.

   * Previous-key and next-key movement commands were not
     correct for B-frames in an MPEG-1 file.
   * Fixed decoding of MPEG-1 B-frames at the start of
     GOPs with broken_link set.
   * Palette change blocks no longer appear as garbage

   * The timeline wasn't properly extended if segments were
     auto-attached by filename after edits had been made.
   * Configuration scripts saved when no file is open
     no longer alter the edit list when loaded.
   * Jobs launched from the command line used the normal
     error modes rather than those set as default by the
     user.

   [regressions fixed]
   * Filter preview buttons weren't updating the frame.
   * Save Image Sequence command would randomly produce
     an unrequested job instead of initiating the render

     a find or save command.
   * "Attach extension" option didn't work for signpost
     save dialog.

     operation, and then occur again when attempting to
     gracefully finalize the partial output file.
   * "Clear" didn't work in audio filter graph.
   * Fixed I/O errors when attempting to push audio forward
     with advanced audio filtering enabled.
   * "Go to" command didn't handle timestamps with frac-
     tional seconds that only had 1 or 2 decimal digits.
   * "General convolution" generated bad code for factors
     of 2, 4, and 8 when dynamic compilation was enabled.

   [features added]
   * Added workaround for infinite B-frame delay
     interaction with DivX 5.0.5 Pro.
   * File information for AVI files now shows estimated
     bitrate.

   [bugs fixed]
   * Fixed race condition in processing pipeline shutdown
     that was more likely to occur in Windows 95/98.
   * Key frame markers were getting written on some drop
     frames when upsampling the video stream.
   * MPEG code was issuing warnings whenever decode time-
     stamps were more than 0.62s apart; this has been
     fixed to use the actual spec limit of 0.7s.
   * Operation couldn't be aborted while B-frame lag
     frames were being flushed at the end.
   * Fixed a bad error message that displayed a bogus
     filename.

Build 16250 (Version 1.5.3):          [May 19, 2003]

     results in Direct video mode.  It now produces source
     frames interspersed with drop frames for nearly zero-
     cost point upsampling of video.
   * Dubber pretended there was a input-to-output lag if
     such filters existed in the video chain (temporal
     smoother), even if the filters weren't active.  This
     resulting in duplicated frames (fast/normal) or
     erroneous zero-byte keyframes (direct) at the end of
     the output.
   * Arbitrary framerate conversion option wasn't disabled
     in the UI when IVTC was enabled (the two are mutually
     exclusive).
   * Edit point seeks (<, >) didn't update the frame
     windows.

   [regression bugs fixed]
   * Fixed pipeline not getting flushed at end of
     operation, resulting in some frames getting lost.
   * Fixed subset code pulling in wrong frames in direct
     mode.
   * Interleaving values were inverted and thus always
     forced one-per-frame.
   * Position slider wasn't updating properly around cuts.

     stream with a new sampling rate without resampling.
   * Incomplete audio format headers that are rejected by
     ACM MP3 codecs are automatically fixed with the
     required fields (the infamous "tag 0055" problem).
   * Added workaround for AVI1 files with MP3 audio being
     detected as MP3 files by Windows Media Player 8.

   [features removed]

     highpass audio filters were in use.
   * Fixed internal error when attempting to start an
     incomplete audio filter graph (unconnected pins).

     to audio AVI track headers when converting an MPEG-1
     file.
   * Fixed crash when attempting to load an AVI stream with
     an invalid sample rate (zero or infinite).  Added code
     to guess and substitute a reasonable value.
   * Fixed small memory leak in "smoother" video filter.

     configuration blocks that probably caused some codec
     crashes or configuration funniness.
   * Calls to video codecs now eat MMX errors rather than
     reporting them, to workaround a bug in the MSMPEG4V3
     codec that will probably never be fixed.

     the OpenDML 1.02 (AVI 2.0) extensions, meaning
     capture and processing to >2Gb files is now
     possible.
   * 'Save striped master' greatly speeds up making audio
     master tracks for using frameservers with the VCM
     driver.
   * Built-in MJPEG support -- it's incredibly slow, but
     will kick in for MJPEG files that cannot be processed
     by existing compressors in the system.
   * Capture mode now has a nifty panel on the
     right that delivers more useful information.
   * VirtualDub now catches some formerly fatal exceptions
     during capture and allows for clean shutdown in those
     cases.
   * Volume monitor in capture mode has an oscilloscope and
     spectrum analyzer, and can control Line-In volume.
   * "Big timer" displays running time during a capture.

   [optimizations]
   * Disk write routines adjusted for lower latency writes
     to disk (i.e. faster).

   [bug fixes]
   * MPEG parsing revised to ignore user chunks, fixing
     problems with the Final Fantasy: The Movie trailer.
   * Fixed hanging problems when writing out video frames
     larger than 4Mb.
   * Fixed some problems setting clipping regions with
     striped AVI files.
   * Jobs that are In Progress can no longer be switched
     to Postponed mode.

Build 4150 (Version 1.0 alpha):
   [Features added]
   * Job system.
   * Scripting support.
   * Double-clicking a filter in 'Add Filter' adds it.
   * New 16-bit dithering option dithers 24-bit images down
     to 16-bit 5:5:5 RGB -- the difference is noticeable
     sometimes.
   * Drop Frames During Preview option.
   * Sync to Audio now adjusts the time base rather than
     throttling the output, leading to smoother playback.
   * MPEG requester displays progress in bytes.
   * Audio support for MPEG files using Tomislav Uzelac's
     Amp 0.7.6 engine.

   [optimizations]
   * Bicubic resizes optimized for MMX.
   * MPEG decoding much faster (by about 50%%), and MMX
     optimized.
   * 16-bit RGB MPEG decoding.

   [bug fixes]
   * Audio streams are no longer written out with overly
     large wave formats when in Full Processing Mode.  This
     caused RealEncoder G2 beta 2 to reject PCM audio
     streams from VirtualDub.
   * Fixed a really stupid error: the bicubic resizer won't
     crash on integral multiples anymore.
   * The bilinear/bicubic resize filters have been adjusted
     to better filter when enlarging by an integral factor.
   * Scene Thresholds don't reset when the CPU Preferences
     tab is visited.
   * A race condition during dub shutdown has been fixed.
   * Crash/hang problems with certain size MPEG chunks
     solved.
   * MRUList fixed -- VirtualDub runs under NT again!
   * Predicted size and audio size in status box fixed.
   * Closed a lot of memory leaks, including one caused by
     a buggy CreateDIBSection() under NT4.0.

Build 3174 (Public Release 3):
   [Features added]
   * Striped AVI output mode for higher performance and
     evading the 2Gb limit.
   * Scene forward/reverse.
   * Histogram works on cards with hardware decompression.
   * VCM frameclient driver + support; now XingMPEG Encoder
     can use frameservers.
   * MPEGs can have their P/B frames omitted and/or motion
     vectors truncated to full pels for performance.
   * AVI rekeying, to fix AVIs with bad keyframe flags.
   * Task priority and filename extension behavior
     configurable.
   * Resize filter can now do bicubic filtering in addition
     to bilinear (formerly Linear Interpolation).
   * Flip Horizontally filter.
   * Limit preferences saving.
   * Color can be set for the fill filter.
   * MMX and FPU settings have been moved to Preferences,
     where they can be saved.
   * Double-clicking on a filter entry brings up the
     configure dialog box for that filter.

   [bug fixes]
   * Frameserver setup no longer says 'Korin.'
   * AVI output routines fixed - no longer writes odd-byte
     chunks.
   * Potential crash/hang problems with y-values in the
     fill filter fixed.
   * Filter entries now highlighted after an Add.

Build 2769 (Public Release 2):
   [Features added - main program]
   * Preliminary MPEG support (video only).
   * Histogram support. Click on the histograms to cycle
     between R/G/B/I modes.
   * Dubbing and capture windows now show filename.
   * Support for compressed 8-bit AVI files.
   * Audio compression and decompression.
   * Left, right arrow keys fine-step frames.
   * New output mode: individual DIB frames.
   * Context help for all capture and some dub dialogs.
   * Frameserver mode, to serve processed video output to
     other applications in real-time.
   * Vertical flip filter.
   * MRU (Most recently used) list.
   * Interleaving options now work.

   [Features added - capture]
   * Capture mode now has accelerators.
   * Total size during internal capture.
   * Histogram works on capture cards that use hardware
     compression.
   * Capture file, driver, and settings can be saved.

   [optimizations]
   * Larger granularity for index blocks.
   * Resize filter heavily optimized for FPU - linear
     interpolation now runs at full speed on many AVIs,
     without an MMX CPU.
   * Slightly better interface performance under NT.
   * Output buffering works now.
   * Internal capture mode - much better capture
     performance.

   [bug fixes]
   * Output file properly closed upon write failures.
   * Audio offset/clipping parameters fixed for frame rate
     decimation.
   * WAV files now closed when disabled.
   * Time limit for captures fixed; no longer alters the
     audio buffer size.
   * Conversion routines fixed for odd AVI widths; solves
     crash problems on many AVIs, particularly in 16-bit
     decompression mode.
   * ICDecompress() now used with decompressors that do
     not support ICDecompressEx().  This allows the
     miroVideo DRX MJPEG decompressor to work with
     VirtualDub.
   * Titlebars no longer refreshed every 1/2 second
     unless necessary -- speeds up dubs on slow systems.
   * Problems with audio-less files fixed.
   * Fixed range dialog from 'locking' when length(ms)
     field cleared.
   * Dynamic compilation filters work under NT.
   * Fixed corruption/crash problems with convolution
     based filters.

   * Rounding/overflow errors in clipping dialog gone.
   * 8-bit AVIs now supported.
   * End-of-file race condition fixed.
   * AVI length write fixed
     (NOTE: If you have files which give errors at the end
            of processing, trim the end back and turn on
        Audio clipping.)
   * Audio interleaving fixed.
   * Preview mode audio playback no longer cut off.
   * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
